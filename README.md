# inpack
This program is a PyInstaller-based application for converting Python scripts into executable files, built with `customtkinter`. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to streamline the conversion process, allowing users to specify project details, main script, output executable name, and an optional icon. The GUI, designed for clarity and ease of use, includes input fields for the project path, the main Python script, and the desired name for the executable. Additionally, it features options for generating a single-file executable and suppressing the console window, common requirements for distributing Python applications. The application validates user inputs to ensure all necessary fields are provided and the main script is a valid Python file. Upon initiating the conversion, it spawns a separate thread to execute the PyInstaller command, preventing the GUI from freezing. A loading pop-up provides feedback during the compilation process, enhancing the user experience. Error handling is robust, catching issues such as missing PyInstaller installations, invalid inputs, and conversion failures, and presenting them to the user via informative message boxes. The program manages directory changes to ensure PyInstaller operates correctly within the project context and restores the original working directory upon completion or error. It targets users who need to package their Python applications for distribution, simplifying a complex command-line process into a few clicks.
